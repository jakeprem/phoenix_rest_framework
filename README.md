# PhoenixRestFramework

Still very much a work in progress. Expect major breaking changes. With that being said it does work as a basic proof of concept

## Installation

The package can be installed
by adding `phoenix_rest_framework` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:phoenix_rest_framework, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

The docs can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_rest_framework>.
